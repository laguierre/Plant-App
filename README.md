# Plant App

A Plant APP inspired in the [video from Youtube](https://youtu.be/LN668OAUrK4) and the [GIT](https://github.com/abuanwar072/Plant-App-Flutter-UI)
Without using any State Manager and any other package than flutter_svg

**Packages we are using:**

- flutter_svg: [link](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg)

Nice clean plant app UI using flutter, the Home page you "will get search box" than a horizontal list of recommended plants. At the bottom featured plans list.
When you scroll up, the widgets near to search bar apply the opacity and transform.scale.
On the details page, a Hero transitions was used, a big image with its 4 icons on the right side also add to the cart button.
